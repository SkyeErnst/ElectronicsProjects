Resistor values near output op amps are nominal

Testing each of the output op amps sets of TI 48Z (~ THS3095)
Left:
13.3v on Vout without prior output of the generator
After both generators have been activated reads -13mV~
After activating channel 1 Left Vout reads 13.3v
After activating channel 2 Left Vout reads -30mV



Right:
13.3v on Vout without prior output of the generator
After both generators have been activated reads -7V~
After activating channel 1 Right Vout reads -13mV~
After activating channel 2 Right Vout reads 13.3V

AD8512 Test
Before any channel is turned on, the two AD8512s have about -6.5mV/-17-18mV on their OUT Bs and As. It seems to fluctuate in an increasingly negative trend.

A 6.3mV, B 7.1mV
Front most AD8512 results which changed when the first channel was enabled with the default waveform.

A 6.6mV, B 6.8mV 
Rear most AD8512 results which changed when the second channel was enabled with the default waveform.
